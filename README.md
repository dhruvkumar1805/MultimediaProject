üé¨ Project Description:
In this project, I created an animated bee character flying across the sky. The animation includes the following elements:
‚Ä¢	A cartoon bee with moving wings to simulate flying.
‚Ä¢	Background clouds that slowly move to create the illusion of motion.
‚Ä¢	A looping animation that gives life to a simple scene.
The bee‚Äôs wings were animated using motion tweens, while the background was made dynamic with slow-moving cloud layers. The entire scene plays smoothly and is designed to be playful and engaging.
